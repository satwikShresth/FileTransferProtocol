/**
 * @file ThreadPool.h
 * @brief This file contains the definition of the ThreadPool class, which manages a pool of threads to execute tasks concurrently.
 * 
 * @section Description
 * The ThreadPool class is responsible for managing a pool of worker threads that can execute tasks concurrently. 
 * It provides methods to submit tasks, manage task queues, and ensure all tasks are completed before shutting down.
 *
 * @section Reference
 * This program was developed with insights and techniques from the book:
 * - C++ Concurrency in Action (Second Edition) by Anthony Williams.
