/**
 * @file WorkStealQueue.h
 * @brief This file contains the definition of the WorkStealQueue class template, which implements a thread-safe work-stealing queue.
 *
 * @section Description
 * The WorkStealQueue class is designed to allow tasks to be pushed and popped by the owner thread,
 * and also stolen by other threads to balance the workload across multiple threads.
 *
 * @section Reference
 * This program was developed with insights and techniques from the book:
 * - C++ Concurrency in Action (Second Edition) by Anthony Williams.
